The way I render the blocks in this game is kinda weird I am not lying. I used a list of numbers to indicate the position x,y of the next piece within the block compared to the center. 
So everytime the block rotates, I have to manually rearrage those tiles/the reading order of the list.
But anyways, it works just fine. This is a rather primitive version of Tetris.
INSTRUCTIONS : ARROW KEYS TO ACCELERATE/CHANGE COLUMNS, WASD FOR ROTATING BLOCKS.
A bit of entertainment as I am a bit bored with the Enemy AI in 2D shooter, it is so DEPRESSING to code. 
Have a great day! CELEBRATE GOOD TIMES C'MON!
